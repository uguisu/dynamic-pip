# dynamic-Pip Get start

[中文](index_cn.md)

`dynamic-Pip` can help users easily dynamically manage python package resources at runtime.

## Advantage
- Dynamic addition/deletion management of `packages` at runtime
- Automaticlly select `PyPI` mirror site to speed up `package` installation
- Generate dependency tree between `packages` to facilitate subsequent management.
- Relying only on an open source network speed test library, it is very intrusive to the project. Avoid version conflicts.
