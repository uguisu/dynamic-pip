# Case: Private deployment

Adapted from real cases

## Background
- An AI project needs to be deployed on a customer's private cloud
- This private cloud cannot be connected to the public network
- Customer requires an installation program to achieve "one-click installation" and does not want to accept the on-site deployment method
- The running hardware of customer's private cloud is not fixed. Some hardware comes with `Nvidia GPU`, while others only provide `Intel CPU`


## Solution

### Collect offline installation packages

```sh
# change to your local path
export target_path=<PATH>

# download base packages
pip download -d $target_path -r requirements-base.txt

# download GPU relateded packages
pip download -d $target_path -r requirements-gpus.txt

# download CPU relateded packages
pip download -d $target_path -r requirements-cpus.txt
```
### Adjust code
Adjust the code to dynamically select the installation list according to the runtime environment

```python
# check device
is_has_gpu = function_check_gpu()

target_pkg_list = []

if is_has_gpu:
    # has GPU
    target_pkg_list = [
        'torch==2.2.0',
        # ...
    ]
else:
    # CPU only
    target_pkg_list = [
        'openvino',
        # ...
    ]

from dynamicPip import DynamicPip
dynamic_pip = DynamicPip()

# install
print(f'----- install {target_pkg_list} test -----')
# rtn = dynamic_pip.install_package(target_pkg_list)
rtn = dynamic_pip.make_sure_packages(target_pkg_list)
print(f'return result code {rtn}\n')
self.assertTrue(0 == rtn)
```

### Make installation package
Copy the product to be deployed and the installation package downloaded above to the same path and compress it.

```sh
tar ...
zip ...
```

### Deployment
Decompress directly in the customer's private cloud environment and run it.
